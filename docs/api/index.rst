Auxjad API
==========

Auxjad is made out of four subpackages: |core|_, |indicators|_, |score|_, and
|utilities|_. |core|_ contains most of Auxjad's classes and is focused on
algorithmic transformations and manipulations of |abjad.Container| objects.
|indicators|_ contain extension methods for Abjad's indicators. |score|_
contains score component and component maker classes, such as an expanded leaf
maker as well as harmonic leaves. |utilities|_ contains mutation and inspection
methods as well as a couple of utility functions.

.. note::

    Auxjad classes and functions are imported directly into the |auxjad|_
    namespace. Therefore, to use a class such as
    :class:`auxjad.CartographySelector` you only need to import |auxjad|_ and
    instantiate the class from its namespace:

    >>> import auxjad
    >>> selector = auxjad.CartographySelector(pitch_list)

The documentation for the members of each subpackage can be below, as well as
in the navigation pane in the left.
