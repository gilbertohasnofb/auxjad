class TenneySelector():
    r"""This in an implementation of the Dissonant Counterpoint Algorithm by
    James Tenney. This class can be used to randomly select elements from an
    input list, giving more weight to elements which have not been selected in
    recent iterations. In other words, Tenney's algorithm uses feedback in
    order to lower the weight of recently selected elements.

    This implementation is based on the paper: Polansky, L., A. Barnett, and
    M. Winter (2011). 'A Few More Words About James Tenney: Dissonant
    Counterpoint and Statistical Feedback'. In: Journal of Mathematics and
    Music 5(2). pp. 63--82.

    ..  container:: example

        The selector should be initialised with a list of objects. The elements
        of this list can be of any type.

        >>> selector = auxjad.TenneySelector(['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F'])
        >>> selector.contents
        ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']

        Applying the ``len()`` function to the selector will return the length
        of the input list.

        >>> len(selector)
        6

        When no other keyword arguments are used, the default probabilities of
        each element in the list is 1.0. Probabilities are not normalised. Use
        the previous_index attribute to check the previously selected index
        (default is None).

        >>> selector.probabilities
        [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]
        >>> selector.previous_index
        None

        Calling the selector will output one of its elements, selected
        according to the current probability values.

        >>> selector()
        C

        Alternatively, use the ``next()`` function or ``__next__()`` method to
        get the next result.

        >>> selector.__next__()
        A
        >>> next(selector)
        D

        After each call, the object updates all probability values, setting the
        previously selected element's probability at 0.0 and raising all other
        probabilities according to a growth function (more on this below).

        >>> result = ''
        >>> for _ in range(30):
        ...     result += selector()
        >>> result
        EDFACEABAFDCEDAFADCBFEDABEDFEC

        From the result above it is possible to see that there are no immediate
        repetitions of elements (since once selected, their probability is
        always set to 0.0 and will take at least one iteration to grow to a
        non-zero value). Checking the ``probabilities`` and ``previous_index``
        properties will return us their current values.

        >>> selector.probabilities
        [6.0, 5.0, 0.0, 3.0, 1.0, 2.0]
        >>> selector.previous_index
        2

    ..  container:: example

        This class can take two optional keywords argument during its
        instantiation, namely ``weights`` and ``curvature``. ``weights`` takes
        a list of floats with the individual weights of each element; by
        default,  all weights are set to 1.0. These weights affects the
        effective probability of each element. The other argument,
        ``curvature``, is the exponent of the growth function for all elements.
        The growth function takes as input the number of iterations since an
        element has been last selected, and raise this number by the curvature
        value. If ``curvature`` is set to 1.0 (which is its default value), the
        growth is linear with each iteration. If set to a value larger than 0.0
        and less than 1.0, the growth is negative (or concave), so that the
        chances of an element which is not being selected will grow at ever
        smaller rates as the number of iterations it has not been selected
        increase. If the ``curvature`` is set to 1.0, the growth is linear with
        the number of iterations. If the ``curvature`` is larger than 1.0, the
        curvature is positive (or convex) and the growth will accelerate as the
        number of iterations an element has not been selected grows. Setting
        the curvature to 0.0 will result in an static probability vector with
        all values set to 1.0, except for the previously selected one which
        will be set to 0.0; this will result in a uniformly random selection
        without repetition.

        With linear curvature (default value of 1.0):

        >>> selector = auxjad.TenneySelector(['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F'])
        >>> selector.curvature
        1.0
        >>> selector.weights
        [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]
        >>> selector.probabilities
        [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]
        >>> selector()
        'B'
        >>> selector.curvature
        1.0
        >>> selector.weights
        [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]
        >>> selector.probabilities
        [2.0, 0.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]

    ..  container:: example

        Using a convex curvature:

        >>> selector = auxjad.TenneySelector(['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F'],
        ...                                  curvature=0.2,
        ...                                  )
        >>> selector.curvature
        0.2
        >>> selector.weights
        [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]
        >>> selector.probabilities
        [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]
        >>> selector()
        'C'
        >>> selector.curvature
        0.2
        >>> selector.weights
        [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]
        >>> selector.probabilities
        [1.148698354997035, 1.148698354997035, 0.0, 1.148698354997035,
        1.148698354997035, 1.148698354997035]

        With a convex curvature, the growth of the probability of each
        non-selected term gets smaller as the number of times it is not
        selected increases. The smaller the curvature is, the less difference
        there will be between any non-previously selected elements. This
        results in sequences which have more chances of a same element being
        near each other. In the sequence below, note how there are many cases
        of a same element being separated only by a single other one, such as
        ``'ACA'`` in index 6.

        >>> result = ''
        >>> for _ in range(30):
        ...     result += selector()
        >>> result
        DACBEDFACABDACECBEFAEDBAFBABFD

        Checking the probability values at this point outputs:

        >>> selector.probabilities
        [1.2457309396155174, 1.148698354997035, 1.6952182030724354, 0.0,
        1.5518455739153598, 1.0]

        As we can see, all non-zero values are relatively close to each other,
        which is why there is a high chance of an element being selected again
        just two iterations apart.

    ..  container:: example

        Using a concave curvature:

        >>> selector = auxjad.TenneySelector(['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F'],
        ...                                  curvature=15.2,
        ...                                  )
        >>> selector.curvature
        0.2
        >>> selector.weights
        [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]
        >>> selector.probabilities
        [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]
        >>> selector()
        'C'
        >>> selector.curvature
        0.2
        >>> selector.weights
        [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]
        >>> selector.probabilities
        [37640.547696542824, 37640.547696542824, 37640.547696542824, 0.0,
        37640.547696542824, 37640.547696542824]

        With a concave curvature, the growth of the probability of each
        non-selected term gets larger as the number of times it is not selected
        increases. The larger the curvature is, the larger difference there
        will be between any non-previously selected elements. This results in
        sequences which have less chances of a same element being near each
        other. In the sequence below, with a curvature of 15.2, note how the
        elements are as far apart from each other, resulting in a repeating
        string of ``'DFAECB'``.

        >>> result = ''
        >>> for _ in range(30):
        ...     result += selector()
        >>> result
        DFAECBDFAECBDFAECBDFAECBDFAECB

        Checking the probability values at this point outputs:

        >>> selector.probabilities
        [17874877.39956566, 0.0, 1.0, 42106007735.02238,
        37640.547696542824, 1416810830.8957152]

        As we can see, the non-zero values vary wildly. The higher the
        curvature, the higher the difference between these values, making some
        of them much more likely to be selected.

    ..  container:: example

        Each element can also have a fixed weight to themselves. This will
        affect the probability calculation. The example below uses the default
        linear curvature.

        >>> selector = auxjad.TenneySelector(
        ...     ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F'],
        ...     weights=[1.0, 1.0, 5.0, 5.0, 10.0, 20.0],
        >>> )
        >>> selector.weights
        [1.0, 1.0, 5.0, 5.0, 10.0, 20.0]
        >>> selector.probabilities
        [1.0, 1.0, 5.0, 5.0, 10.0, 20.0]
        >>> result = ''
        >>> for _ in range(30):
        ...     result += selector()
        >>> result
        FBEFECFDEADFEDFEDBFECDAFCEDCFE
        >>> selector.weights
        [1.0, 1.0, 5.0, 5.0, 10.0, 20.0]
        >>> selector.probabilities
        [7.0, 12.0, 10.0, 15.0, 0.0, 20.0]

    ..  container:: example

        To reset the probability distribution of all elements to its initial
        value (an uniform distribution), use the method
        ``reset_probabilities()``.

        >>> selector = auxjad.TenneySelector(['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F'])
        >>> for _ in range(30):
        ...     selector()
        >>> selector.probabilities
        [4.0, 3.0, 1.0, 0.0, 5.0, 2.0]
        >>> selector.reset_probabilities()
        >>> selector.probabilities
        [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]

    ..  container:: example

        The ``contents`` of instances of this class can be indexed and sliced.
        This allows reading, assigning, or deleting values from ``contents``.
        Replacing elements by assignment will not affect the ``probabilities``
        property, and the new elements will have the same probability as the
        ones it replaced. Deleting element will delete the probability of that
        index.

        >>> selector = auxjad.TenneySelector(['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F'])
        >>> for _ in range(30):
        ...     selector()
        >>> selector.probabilities
        [3.0, 2.0, 1.0, 7.0, 5.0, 0.0]
        >>> selector[2]
        'C'
        >>> selector[1:4]
        ['B', 'C', 'D']
        >>> selector[2] = 'foo'
        >>> selector.contents
        ['A', 'B', 'foo', 'D', 'E', 'F']
        >>> selector[:] = ['foo', 'bar', 'X', 'Y', 'Z', '...']
        >>> selector.contents
        ['foo', 'bar', 'X', 'Y', 'Z', '...']
        >>> selector.probabilities
        [3.0, 2.0, 1.0, 7.0, 5.0, 0.0]
        >>> del selector[0:2]
        >>> selector.contents
        ['X', 'Y', 'Z', '...']
        >>> selector.probabilities
        [1.0, 7.0, 5.0, 0.0]

        You can also check if the instance contains a specific element. In the
        case of the selector above, we have:

        >>> 'X' in selector
        True
        >>> 'A' in selector
        False

    ..  container:: example

        A new list of an arbitrary length can be set at any point using the
        property ``contents``. Do notice that both ``probabilities`` and
        ``weights`` will be reset at that point.

        >>> selector = auxjad.TenneySelector(
        ...     ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F'],
        ...     weights=[1.0, 1.0, 5.0, 5.0, 10.0, 20.0],
        >>> )
        >>> for _ in range(30):
        ...     selector()
        >>> len(selector)
        6
        >>> selector.contents
        ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']
        >>> selector.weights
        [1.0, 1.0, 5.0, 5.0, 10.0, 20.0]
        >>> selector.probabilities
        [8.0, 2.0, 5.0, 15.0, 50.0, 0.0]
        >>> selector.contents = [2, 4, 6, 8]

        [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]

        To change the curvature value at any point, simply set the property
        ``curvature`` to a different value.

        >>> selector = auxjad.TenneySelector(['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F'])
