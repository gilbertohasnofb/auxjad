class CartographySelector():
    r"""A selector used to store, manipulate, and select objects using a
    weighted function constructed with a fixed decay rate. The decay rate
    represents the ratio of probabilities of any index given the probability of
    the preceeding one. For instance, if the decay rate is set to ``0.75``
    (which is its default value), the probability of the element in index 1 of
    the input list being selected is 0.75 the probability of the element in
    index 0, and the probability of the element in index 2 is 0.5625 (0.75^2)
    the probability of the element in index 0. This is the selector used in my
    *Cartography* series of compositions.

    ..  container:: example

        The selector should be initialised with a list of objects. The elements
        of this list can be of any type.

        >>> selector = auxjad.CartographySelector([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
        >>> selector.contents
        [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

        The default decay rate is 0.75; that is, the weight of any given
        elements is the weight of the previous one multiplied by 0.75. The
        weights are associated with the index position, not the elements
        themselves.

        >>> selector.weights
        [1.0, 0.75, 0.5625, 0.421875, 0.31640625]

        Applying the ``len()`` function to the selector will return the length
        of the input list.

        >>> len(selector)
        5

        Calling the selector will output one of its elements, selected
        according to its weight function.

        >>> selector()
        2

        Alternatively, use the ``next()`` function or ``__next__()`` method to
        get the next result.

        >>> selector.__next__()
        1
        >>> next(selector)
        0

    ..  container:: example

        By default, only the weight function (defined by the decay rate) is
        taken into consideration when selecting an element. This means that
        repeated elements can appear, as shown below.

        >>> result = ''
        >>> for _ in range(30):
        ...     result += str(selector())
        >>> result
        203001402200011111101400310140

        Calling the selector with the optional keyword argument ``no_repeat``
        set to ``True`` will forbid immediate repetitions among consecutive
        calls.

        >>> selector = auxjad.CartographySelector([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
        >>> result = ''
        >>> for _ in range(30):
        ...     result += str(selector(no_repeat=True))
        >>> result
        210421021020304024230120241202

    ..  container:: example

        The keyword argument ``decay_rate`` can be used to set a different
        decay rate when creating a selector.

        >>> selector = auxjad.CartographySelector([0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
        ...                                       decay_rate=0.5,
        ...                                       )
        >>> selector.weights
        [1.0, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, 0.0625]

        The decay rate can also be set after the creation of a selector using,
        the property ``decay_rate``.

        >>> selector = auxjad.CartographySelector([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
        >>> selector.decay_rate = 0.2
        >>> selector.weights
        [1.0, 0.2, 0.04000000000000001, 0.008000000000000002,
        0.0016000000000000003]
        >>> result = ''
        >>> for _ in range(30):
        ...     result += str(selector())
        >>> result
        '000001002100000201001030000100'

    ..  container:: example

        Appending is a type of content transformation. It discards the first
        element of the selector's ``contents``, shifts all others leftwards,
        and then appends the new element to the last index.

        >>> selector = auxjad.CartographySelector([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
        >>> selector.contents
        [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
        >>> selector.append(5)
        >>> selector.contents
        [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        >>> selector.append(42)
        >>> selector.contents
        [2, 3, 4, 5, 42]

    ..  container:: example

        The method ``append_keeping_n()`` is similar to ``append()``, but it
        keeps the first ``n`` elements of ``contents`` untouched. It thus
        discards the n+1-th element, shifts all the next elements one position
        lefwards, and finally appends the new element at the last index.

        >>> selector = auxjad.CartographySelector([10, 7, 14, 31, 98])
        >>> selector.contents
        [10, 7, 14, 31, 98]
        >>> selector.append_keeping_n(100, 2)
        >>> selector.contents
        [10, 7, 31, 98, 100]

    ..  container:: example

        Prepending is another type of content transformation. It discards the
        last element of the ``contents``, shifts all others rightwards, and
        then prepends the new element to the first index.

        >>> selector = auxjad.CartographySelector([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
        >>> selector.contents
        [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
        >>> selector.prepend(-1)
        >>> selector.contents
        [-1, 0, 1, 2, 3]
        >>> selector.prepend(71)
        >>> selector.contents
        [71, -1, 0, 1, 2]

    ..  container:: example

        Rotation is another type of content transformation. It rotates all
        elements rightwards, moving the last element to the first index. If the
        optional keyword argument ``anticlockwise`` is set to ``True``, the
        rotation will be in the opposite direction.

        >>> selector = auxjad.CartographySelector([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
        >>> selector.contents
        [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
        >>> selector.rotate()
        >>> selector.contents
        [1, 2, 3, 4, 0]
        >>> selector.rotate(anticlockwise=True)
        >>> selector.contents
        [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
        >>> selector.rotate(anticlockwise=True)
        >>> selector.contents
        [1, 2, 3, 4, 0]

    ..  container:: example

        The mirror transformation swaps the element of the input index with its
        complementary element. Complementary elements are defined as the pair
        of elements which share the same distance from the centre of the
        ``contents`` (in terms of number of indeces), and are located at either
        side.

        >>> selector = auxjad.CartographySelector([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
        >>> selector.contents
        [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
        >>> selector.mirror(0)
        >>> selector.contents
        [4, 1, 2, 3, 0]
        >>> selector.mirror(0)
        >>> selector.contents
        [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
        >>> selector.mirror(3)
        >>> selector.contents
        [0, 3, 2, 1, 4]
        >>> selector.mirror(2)
        >>> selector.contents
        [0, 3, 2, 1, 4]

    ..  container:: example

        To mirror a random pair of complementary elements, use the
        ``mirror_random()`` method. In case of a selector with an odd number
        of elements, this method will never pick an element at the pivot point
        since the operation would not change the contents.

        >>> selector = auxjad.CartographySelector([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
        >>> selector.contents
        [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
        >>> selector.mirror_random()
        >>> selector.contents
        [4, 1, 2, 3, 0]
        >>> selector.mirror_random()
        >>> selector.contents
        [4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
        >>> selector.mirror_random()
        >>> selector.contents
        [4, 1, 2, 3, 0]

    ..  container:: example

        The method ``shuffle()`` will shuffle the position of the elements of
        the selector's ``contents``.

        >>> selector = auxjad.CartographySelector([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
        >>> selector.contents
        [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
        >>> selector.shuffle()
        >>> selector.contents
        [1, 4, 3, 0, 2]

    ..  container:: example

        The contents of a selector can also be altered after it has been
        initialised using the ``contents`` property. The length of the
        contents can change as well.

        >>> selector = auxjad.CartographySelector([0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
        ...                                       decay_rate=0.5,
        ...                                       )
        >>> len(selector)
        5
        >>> selector.weights
        [1.0, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, 0.0625]
        >>> selector.contents = [10, 7, 14, 31, 98, 47, 32]
        >>> selector.contents
        [10, 7, 14, 31, 98, 47, 32]
        >>> len(selector)
        7
        >>> selector.weights
        [1.0, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, 0.0625, 0.03125, 0.015625]

    ..  container:: example

        Use the read-only properties ``previous_result`` and ``previous_index``
        to output the previous result and its index.

        >>> selector = auxjad.CartographySelector([10, 7, 14, 31, 98])
        >>> selector()
        14
        >>> previous_index = selector.previous_index
        >>> previous_index
        2
        >>> selector.previous_result
        14

    ..  container:: example

        The ``contents`` of instances of this class can be indexed and sliced.
        This allows reading, assigning, or deleting values from ``contents``.

        >>> selector = auxjad.CartographySelector([10, 7, 14, 31, 98])
        >>> selector[1]
        7
        >>> selector[1:4]
        [7, 14, 31]
        >>> selector[:]
        [10, 7, 14, 31, 98]
        >>> selector()
        31
        >>> previous_index = selector.previous_index
        >>> previous_index

        >>> selector[previous_index]

        >>> selector.contents
