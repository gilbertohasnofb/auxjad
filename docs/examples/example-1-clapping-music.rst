Steve Reich's *Clapping Music*
==============================

In this example, we will use some of |auxjad|_'s classes and functions to
generate the score of Steve Reich's *Clapping Music*.

First, we start by importing both :mod:`abjad` and |auxjad|_.

    >>> import abjad
    >>> import auxjad

Let's now input the basic material that will be used to generate this
composition. The original score is notated using a rhythmic staff, so we can
initialise |abjad.Staff| with the property
:attr:`lilypond_type <abjad.core.Staff.Staff.lilypond_type>`. set to
``"RhythmicStaff"``.

    >>> material = abjad.Staff(r"\time 12/8 c8 c c r c c r c r c c r",
    ...                        lilypond_type="RhythmicStaff",
    ...                        )
    >>> abjad.f(material)
    \new RhythmicStaff
    {
        \time 12/8
        c8
        c8
        c8
        r8
        c8
        c8
        r8
        c8
        r8
        c8
        c8
        r8
    }

Next, we create an instance of :class:`auxjad.Phaser` which will be used to
create the phasing process of the initial material. We initialise it with
``material`` as well as a ``step_size`` of the length of a quaver.

    >>> phaser = auxjad.Phaser(material,
    ...                        step_size=abjad.Duration((1, 8)),
    ...                        )

Since Reich's composition phases the material until it is back at its initial
position, we can use the method ``output_all()`` to generate all thirteen
measures of the bottom staff.

    >>> notes = phaser.output_all()
    >>> phased_staff = abjad.Staff(notes,
    ...                            lilypond_type="RhythmicStaff",
    ...                            )
    >>> abjad.f(phased_staff)
    \new RhythmicStaff
    {
        \time 12/8

The upper staff of the composition consists of thirteen measures of the
material being repeated. We can thus use the function
:func:`auxjad.repeat_container()` to generate these repetitions and take care
of removing the time signatures of the repeated measures.

    >>> constant_staff = auxjad.repeat_container(material, 13)
    >>> abjad.f(constant_staff)

With both staves created, we can now add them to a single score.

    >>> score = abjad.Score([constant_staff, phased_staff])
    >>> abjad.f(score)

        \new RhythmicStaff

We now group the leaves of the upper staff by measures and add a double
repetition bar line to the last leaf of each measure. The very last leaf of the
score should have a single end repetition bar line.

    >>> measures = abjad.select(constant_staff[:]).group_by_measure()
    >>> for measure in measures[:-1]:
    ...     abjad.attach(abjad.BarLine(':..:'), measure[-1])
    >>> abjad.attach(abjad.BarLine(':|.'), constant_staff[-1])
    >>> abjad.f(score)
